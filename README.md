The program, MarkEntering.java, prompts the user to enter their marks. Depending on the marks entered, the program categorizes the achievement into one of the following categories: OUTSTANDING, MERITORIOUS, SUBSTANTIAL, MODERATE, ADEQUATE &  ELEMENTARY ACHIEVEMENT AND NOT ACHIEVED - FAIL.

    Outstanding Achievement: Marks are 80 or above.
    Meritorious Achievement: Marks are between 70 and 79.
    Substantial Achievement: Marks are between 60 and 69.
    Moderate Achievement: Marks are between 50 and 59.

    Elementary Achievement: Marks are between 30 and 39.
    Not Achieved - Fail: Marks are below 30.

If the marks entered are not between 0 and 100, the program will display a message asking the user to type marks that are between 0-100.
If the marks entered are not of a value of a number, the program displays an error message
